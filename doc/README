2005-03-02 (v1.0.0.0)

v1.0 is FINALLY released, with all the features I wanted. Flexible 
design, simple layout, and easy-to-write modules. With a bit of luck, it 
will be a long time before you see another release of the enBot core. 
All the work should be done in the modules, unless there is a bug in the 
core. Thanks to everyone who helped test this, and who enjoyed the 
previous versions enough for me to keep working on this.


v2005-03-03 (v1.0.0.1)

Improved efficiency of Echo() slightly. Removed an unneeded argument.


v2005-03-13 (v1.0.1.0)

BUGFIX - Killed the stupid bug that rendered the LogMessage() subroutine 
useless. >_< The regex was inverted, and I didn't notice.


v2005-04-15 (v1.0.2.0)

Modified the logging system again. Now it logs to db/log/channelname.log, 
and creates a seperate logfile for each channel.


v2005-04-15 (v1.0.2.1)

BUGFIX - Logfiles append, not overwrite.


v2005-04-15 (v1.0.2.2)

BUGFIX - Logs now contain newlines. >_<


v2005-09-20 (v1.0.3.0)

It's been awhile since I worked on enBot, mostly because there wasn't 
anything noticeably wrong with it. One thing that's always been a minor 
annoyance from the start of Series-1 though, is having to edit enbot.pl 
every time you add a new module. That file should never have to be touched.
So I tweaked it a little, and decided to make it read from the settings file.
So config/modules.ini now has a [Core] section, with a 'Module Index' entry.
An additional trigger has been added, !listmodules.


v2005-12-12 (v1.1.0.0)

Just under three months since the last core change, and this one is just a
feature extension, rather than a bugfix. The core seems very solid thus far.
The version number has been bumped, because this change (while small), is 
significant enough that if your module depends on it, it will require this 
version or newer.

This alteration allows non-command messages to be handled by modules. All you 
really have to do, is overwrite the 'Second Stage Handler' under [Core], in
config/modules.ini.



v2005-12-12 (v1.1.1.0)
This fix adds a function in modules/core.pm, to save an INI file. Use of this 
function, rather than your own, will cause dependance on this version or 
newer. I considered this worth adding, since I keep recycling this function in
other modules ANYWAYS.
