2005-03-02 (v1.0.0.0)
v1.0 is FINALLY released, with all the features I wanted. Flexible 
design, simple layout, and easy-to-write modules. With a bit of luck, it 
will be a long time before you see another release of the enBot core. 
All the work should be done in the modules, unless there is a bug in the 
core. Thanks to everyone who helped test this, and who enjoyed the 
previous versions enough for me to keep working on this.

v2005-03-03 (v1.0.0.1)
Improved efficiency of Echo() slightly. Removed an unneeded argument.

v2005-03-13 (v1.0.1.0)
BUGFIX - Killed the stupid bug that rendered the LogMessage() subroutine 
useless. >_< The regex was inverted, and I didn't notice.

v2005-04-15 (v1.0.2.0)
Modified the logging system again. Now it logs to db/log/channelname.log, 
and creates a seperate logfile for each channel.

v2005-04-15 (v1.0.2.1)
BUGFIX - Logfiles append, not overwrite.

v2005-04-15 (v1.0.2.2)
BUGFIX - Logs now contain newlines. >_<

v2005-09-20 (v1.0.3.0)
It's been awhile since I worked on enBot, mostly because there wasn't 
anything noticeably wrong with it. One thing that's always been a minor 
annoyance from the start of Series-1 though, is having to edit enbot.pl 
every time you add a new module. That file should never have to be touched.
So I tweaked it a little, and decided to make it read from the settings file.
So config/modules.ini now has a [Core] section, with a 'Module Index' entry.
An additional trigger has been added, !listmodules.
